                                    After your event, Eventbrite will send you a confirmation email with the details of your event revenue and payout information.</p>
                                <p>
                                    You have 96 hours (four days) from the end of your event to process any <a href="/en_us/t/refund-an-order">refunds </a>and make any adjustments. On the fifth business day after the end date of your event, Eventbrite will mail you a check (for USD events only) or issue a direct deposit for your total event revenue (less Eventbrite and credit card processing fees).</p>
                                <p>
                                    Direct deposits can take up to two business days to appear in your account after the payout is initiated, depending on your bank; checks generally arrive within five business days after the payout is initiated.</p>

                                    <strong>Note: </strong>Eventbrite is currently only able to process credit card payouts to banks located in a country that uses the currency in which you priced your tickets on Eventbrite. (For instance, if your tickets are priced in US dollars, you will only be able to receive a USD-denominated payout, sent to a bank located in the United States.) If you wish to receive payout in a different currency or to a bank located in a different country, please select a <a href="/en_us/t/payment-processor-options">different payment processor</a> for your event.</p>

                                    For example, if your event ends on a Sunday (1/8), your event payout will be issued on the following Friday (1/13), five days after your event ends. If you've chosen to receive a direct deposit, your funds should arrive in your bank account account by the end of Tuesday (1/17), two business days after the payout is initiated.</p>
                                <p>
                                    As another example, if your event ends on a Monday (1/9), your event payout will be issued on the following Monday (1/16). (Since the fifth day after your event ends is a Saturday (1/14), payout is initiated the next business day, which is Monday (1/16).) If you've chosen to receive a direct deposit, your funds should arrive in your bank account by the end of Wednesday (1/18), two business days after the payout is initiated.</p>

                                <p>
                                    After ticket sales have started on an event, you cannot change the payment processing method. However, you can change it at any time during the setup of your event, and you can use a different method for each event you host.
