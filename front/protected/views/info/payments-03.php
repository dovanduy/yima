                                    - A status of <strong>Processing</strong> means that we are batching and delivering the direct deposit request to our bank or printing and posting the check.

                                    - The&nbsp;<strong>Initiated</strong> status usually only appears briefly for direct deposit (bank transfer) payments, and means that the funds are in the process of being moved to your bank.
                                </p>

                                    - A status of <strong>Sent</strong> will show 5 days after the end of your event, and means that we've sent your payout. (Remember that your payout isn't sent to you until 5 days after the end of the event.)

                                    For US and Canadian accounts, you should receive your check within 5 business days--or your direct deposit within 2 business days--from the&nbsp;<strong>Date of Payment</strong> displayed (or from the next business day, if the <strong>Date of Payment</strong> falls on a weekend or US banking holiday).
                                </p>

                                    For accounts in other countries, you should receive your bank transfer within 4 business days from the&nbsp;<strong>Date of Payment&nbsp;</strong>displayed (or the next business day, if the <strong>Date of Payment</strong> falls on a weekend or US banking holiday).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In general, this means that you should receive the funds into your bank account 5-10 business days after the end of your event. Please keep in mind that the delivery of your funds may be delayed by banking holidays in the country where your bank is located.

                                    - A status of <strong>Processing</strong> means that we are batching and delivering the direct deposit request to our bank or printing and posting the check.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>
                                    - The <strong>Initiated</strong> status usually only appears briefly for direct deposit (bank transfer) payments, and means that the funds are in the process of being moved to your bank.</p>
                                <p>
                                    - A status of <strong>Sent</strong> will show 5 days after the end of your event, and means that we've sent your payout. (Remember that your payout isn't sent to you until 5 days after the end of the event.)</p>
                                <p>

                                    <strong>US AND CANADIAN ACCOUNTS</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    For US and Canadian accounts, you should receive your check within 5 business days--or your direct deposit within 2 business days--from the&nbsp;<strong>Date of Payment</strong> displayed (or from the next business day, if the <strong>Date of Payment</strong> falls on a weekend or US banking holiday).</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>ACCOUNTS IN ALL OTHER COUNTRIES</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    For accounts in other countries, you should receive your bank transfer within 4 business days from the&nbsp;<strong>Date of Payment&nbsp;</strong>displayed (or the next business day, if the <strong>Date of Payment</strong> falls on a weekend or US banking holiday).</p>
                                <p>
                                    In general, this means that you should receive the funds into your bank account 5-10 business days after the end of your event. Please keep in mind that the delivery of your funds may be delayed by banking holidays in the country where your bank is located.</p>
